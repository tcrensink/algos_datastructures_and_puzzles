A repo of data structure and algorithm problems with whiteboard solutions.  Resources:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm
- https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python
- https://awesome-python.com

# To do
- **array sorting algos**
- quicksort 'in place' solution
- mergesort
- heapsort
- shellsort
- radix

- **graph based**
- binary tree implementations/searching
- Djikstra
- A*

- **general knowledge**
- time and space complexity of algorithms (average, worst, etc)


# Implemented algorithms:

O(n^2):
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort

O(n log(n)):
- quick sort
